# E-Glove

## Origin of Proposal:

The idea of creating and developing upon the multi-utility E-Glove was inspired from another peer Electronic Glove project worked upon at IIT Kanpur. Our rigorous research began with the mind-set to come up with an innovative idea that doesnâ€™t just simplify the handling of computer/console controls, but also enhances upon ease of access and mobility. Throughout the study, we came across various technological projects and the Electronic glove was something we wished to go ahead with as our Research and Development project.

## Research Review:

### Research upon mouse operations: 

To implement mouse operations, we need to deal with the three dimensions in a plane (the x, y and z co-ordinates with respect to period of time). This purpose is fulfilled by an accelerometer. The accelerometer refers to an electronic device that is capable of measuring motion and tilt angles. It is also designed to detect rotation and motion gestures like harmonic, periodic and oscillatory movements. 

### Research upon keyboard operations: 

To implement keyboard operations, logic 1 and logic 0 is required for key press and un-press strokes. We plan to decide a circuitry depending upon motion of fingers to implement this function. For example, the bending of index finger would work similar to pressing the spacebar key.

### Research upon control of data: 

We implement the flow and control of analog and digital data bits using the Arduino micro-controller. The micro-controller can sense and control objects in the physical world.
